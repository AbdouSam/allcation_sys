This is a Simple memory allocation system for external SRAM (32bit addressing).
The system is similaire to a FAT system (File Allocation Table.)

The allocation system devides the SRAM into blocks (512bytes) and manage the allocation and the freeing of spaces.

## TODO
- Impliment a Ceedling project to work locally with gcc
- devide the simulation function into its own file
- separate finale code from simulation properly.
- write debugging message that will be permanent on key locations.
